    <p> Theme goals: <br>
        <p2>Create a storyboard describing the story about biking in Copenhagen. My group decided to focus on topic about renting a bike in Cph. We wanted to whos why biking in the capital of Denmark is fun, healthy and easy.</p2>

        What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
            Attention to detail and accuracy with every aspect of the story was very important in this task. I think creating a storyboard is a good way of creating something and a great tool to present other members of your team what your idea is and how you want to present it.
