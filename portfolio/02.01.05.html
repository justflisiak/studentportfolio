    <p> Theme goals: <br>
        <p2>Direct a short video promoting biking in Copenhagen which later will be published on our group website. The story has to have the narrative and dramatic curve, be interesting and fall in receiver memory.</p2>

        What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
        Again great teamwork. Decide to choose one solution with all different ideas is quite a challenging task. Listen to others, respect their ideas and remember that all of you have one goal is the recipe for success.
