         <p> Theme goals: <br>
        <p2>
            Make an interactive animation using javascript. The story had to consist of a few different events that brings the story forward. Also, create the storyboard and the sequence diagram based on this storyboard.

        What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
            One of the most difficult task for me. It was a pair project, but my fellow student also found it difficult, so we made it as good as we could in those time. JS is still not my best suit, but I think it is just one more thing I want to develop myself.
