    <p> Theme goals: <br>
        <p2>Final product of the whole task. Microsite/website/ mobile app concerned about biking in Copenhagen. Here you can find great city tour trips by bike, places where you can rent a bike and my groups' video encourage to bike in cph. Enjoy!</p2>

        What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
            The whole theme was really thoughtful and interesting. Teamwork, design and programming areas connected in one product - our final website.
