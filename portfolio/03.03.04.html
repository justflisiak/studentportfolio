     What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
            What I and my pair had chosen was to create a list to do, which can be changed by adding different things and deleting them from it. Cause we were both more into the design, we also focused on colors and style of the project. This was the next task where I had to use javascript, so I developed myself in this area.
