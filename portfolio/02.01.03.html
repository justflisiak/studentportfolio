    <p> Theme goals: <br>
        <p2>Create a video presenting a short story without any words. The main goal was to play only with music and emotions, but try it express some idea.</p2>
    </p>
    <p>
        What I've learned:<br>
        <p2>
        This project was teamwork. My team decided to create a story about the bad man who feels happy when someone else feels sadness or harm. This film was about carma and fate in every person life. The film shows the truth about the viewer, cause if the audience is laughing during the bad man is, so that means they are also bad?
